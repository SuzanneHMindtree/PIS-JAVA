JAVAFX application interacting with MySQL 


This is a JAVAFX app that interacts with a MySQL database which has four tables. Those tables contain information of a hospital about 
patient info, their stays, their medications, and their surgery.

CRUD (create, retrieve, update, delete) can be done in this app for each table. These four tables are displayed in different tabs of the app.
This app uses the data binding technique that has been made very handy by JAVAFX.
